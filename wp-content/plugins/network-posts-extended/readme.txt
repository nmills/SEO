Also you can specify how many posts should be displayed from each blog. You can set thumbnails image size and style or disable them.You may also include or exclude posts, pages, categories, and blogs by using the appropriate arguments. They're all listed at the end of this file.== Installation ==You may install the plugin using one of the three following methods:<br />1. Unzip file and using an ftp program upload it to the wp-content/plugins/ directory then activate in plugins page.<br />2. Using the search field in the admin plugins area type in 'network posts extended' (without quotes) then install from there.<br />3. Upload zip file through the standard plugins menu.<br />Note: For multisite installations only. You may network activate or activate on each site separately.

Is it possible?<br />A) Use the following arguments: random="true" and list="10" will show ten different posts randomly whenever the page is loaded.Q) May I order my posts in specific order by date or title?<br />A) Yes you may give specific ordering of your posts or pages via alphabetical order (by title), by date or page or post ID specific order.Q) Does this plugin list pages from woocommerce?<br />A) Yes it now does as of version 0.1.4. You may list via page/post id or via taxonomy="custom woocommerce category". Woocommerce default directory/taxonomy is product show you would just use the argument taxonomy="Product" which is the title of the directory. (Not case sensitive)<br /><br />Note: Also works with Tips and Tricks eStore plugin.<br /><br />Q) Will this plugin also include the prices from the products I create with the Woocommerce and eStore plugins?<br />A) Yes it will including the following argument: include_price="woocommerce" or include_price="estore".

You may choose either one by using use_layout="".<br>Q) Can I use shortcode attributes in dynamically created url?<br>A) Yes you may now use the shortcode attributes in a url.

The above plugin will not want you to include the &lt;?php and ?&gt;. Just enter it as so: add_filter('the_excerpt', 'do_shortcode');. If your functions.php file has an opening php tag just insert the latter snippet also.= 3.0 =Added the ability to process shortcodes in the excerpt field. Just set filter_excerpt="true".

When set to inline all meta data and content will be aligned to the right of the image.</li><li>align_thumbnail="" (default is left. May now choose the image to align to the right of the text if use_layout="inline" is chosen.</li><li>wrap_excerpt_container_start="CSS Code Here or anything else for that matter" wrap_excerpt_container_end="". So if you want to add a class to the excerpt/content area you may do so by using wrap_excerpt_container_start="&lt;div class='custom-class'&gt;" wrap_excerpt_container_end="&lt;/div&gt;".</li></ul>= 2.4 =Fixed bug where it stopped working with posty_type="page" and now works with custom post types.

Both will have the texts color turn red.meta_info - Default true= 0.8 =wrap_title_start,wrap_title_end - wrap_image_start,wrap_image_end - wrap_text_start,wrap_text_end.meta_width - Same as title length except in percentage to shorten long meta data.Added the ability to show posts or pages randomly using the following argument: random="true"The list= argument works with pagination= true or false (default: false)= 0.10 =Added the ability to have custom thumbnail sizes created on image upload.You will be able to have image sizes that are also rectangular for better matching on listing your pages.

For example if manual_excerpt_length="400" or excerpt_length="400" and you want posts with less of an excerpt to have same dimensions use this feature. post_height="300" will give a standard height of 300 pixels. So if post has less characters of text will still keep square shape so titles line up nicely.<br /><br />meta_info &#150; Example: meta_info="false" (Default 'true') shows the published date and site title with a link to the home page.<br /><br />meta_length &#150; Example: meta_length="75%" (Default 100%)<br /><br />menu_name &#150; name of the menu (should be created in Appearance > Menu)(default: The one created in Appearance > Menu)<br /><br />menu_class &#150; CSS class for the menu.

Default: false. Note: You must activate the ability to have your site be able to process shortcodes in excerpt field.<br />show_categories &#150; If set to true will also include a link to the category archive page. show_categories="true" default is false.Added ability to call all categories that contain certain keyword or part as in the following example:<br>If you type 'test-%' it will find test-1, test-2, test-3 etc.I.e. it will find categories that starts with 'test-'. if you type '%test' it will find categories that ends with 'test' word.<br>link_open_new_window="true" (default false) for all posts and link_open_new_window="1,2,3,4,5" for posts with given ids.<strong>Using Custom Image Sizes:</strong><br />Under settings > Network Posts Ext menu you will see a box to add a custom image size. You may name it anything you like and use the default alias name or your own. Wants created you must include the following in your shortcode:<br />thumbnail="true" size="Name of Alias". For example if what is listed in the alias box is 600x400 then it would be size="600x400" so your thumbnails will have a size of 600px wide and 400px high. You may change the diplayed size of these images using custom css.<br />For example you may create a class called img-size-300x200 and change the displayed image size thus: .img-size-300x200 &#x7b; height:300px;width:200px; &#x7d;. Then add this to the shortcode: image_class="img-size-300x200".<br />align_image="right",align_image="left.use_layout="default",use_layout="inline"For a complete tutorial please visit: <a href='https://wp-plugins.johncardell.com/' target='ejejcsingle'>https://wp-plugins.johncardell.com/</a>
