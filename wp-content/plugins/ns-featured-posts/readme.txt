<h3>NS Featured Posts</h3>This plugin add checkbox for each list item. You can easily check /  uncheck the Featured. Checking the Featured will set the meta value **yes** for meta key **_is_ns_featured_post**. From plugin settings, you can choose to which post types you want Featured functionality.
